# Machine Learning based Natural Disaster Prediction

##Abstract 

Natural disasters cause significant damage to property and pose a threat to human
lives. To mitigate the impact of these disasters, emergency management teams need to
have preventive strategies in place before these incidents occur. The capstone project
proposes a machine learning approach that integrates historical data of disasters and
weather-related metrics including precipitation, average temperature, extreme temperature (Max and Min), number of cooling and heating days specific to counties across
United States. In addition to this, exploratory data analysis was performed on FEMA
(Federal Emergency Management Agency) disaster and hazard mitigation records, NOAA
(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) weather datasets, and U.S. Census data detailing population to provide data-driven insights on disaster trends, weather
patterns, mitigation projects, and population vulnerabilities across regions. The model
was specifically designed using the merged dataset from FEMA disaster summaries and
NOAAâ€™s weather data. Four machine learning algorithms were used; Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest. The performance of each
model is compared using accuracy measures to select the best approach. An interactive
map is designed with the results of the predictions, which can be utilized by hazard mitigation authorities to allocate resources, identify high-risk areas, and make informed
decisions regarding emergency response strategies. These insights aid policymakers to
design more robust disaster management frameworks aiming to significantly reduce
the impact of future natural calamities
